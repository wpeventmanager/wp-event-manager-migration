In the search field type "WP Event Manager Migration" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.


= Manual installation =


The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.


* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it

* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.

* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.
